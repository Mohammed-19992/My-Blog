                     <p>Mohammed Arafat, 27, is a Palestinian writer and poet who lives in the United States. 
                        He has published a novel called <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Still-Living-There-Mohammad-Arafat/dp/1503274020>Still Living Still</a>, and he writes for some local and 
                        international news sites and organizations.</p>
                        
                     <p>Mohammed Arafat is a 27 year old Palestinian writer and poet from Gaza. He has been a 
                        witness to three violent wars on the strip, where he lost friends and neighbors. 
                        Directly after the 2014 war on Gaza, he published Still Living There, a novel which 
                        talks about a Palestinian farmer forced to leave Haifa to Gaza during the 1948 Nakbah,
                        and the resultant suffering of Palestinian refugees.</p>

                     <p>Mohammed lived in Chile for a year, during which he started a project to reconnect Palestinians of Chile, which has the biggest Palestinian community outside Palestine, to their native culture through poetry.
                        Being an intern at the Capitol Hill, Mohammed is at work on his second book, which uses poetry to talk about his life back home and the Gazan humanitarian crises.
                        Through his work, Mohammed aims to make heard the voices of the voiceless.</p>
